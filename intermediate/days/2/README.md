# Day 2 -The Third Challenge

## Welcome to Day 2

Hello and welcome to day 2. In your last mission, you found 3 passwords and their respective length. To open the locked door, you need to find similar characters between the 1st password and the other 2. This will decodes the final password.
## Mission

Create a program that finds the characters that are the same between the 1st password and the other 2. Print the similar characters. This string must be order. 

## Mission Resources

- [Variables & Data Types](https://github.com/MWCSC/documentation/blob/master/python/0-variables-data-types.md)
- [For loop](https://github.com/MWCSC/documentation/blob/master/python/05-for-loop.md)

## Values:

- Password 1: fads5464gfgfdg4fd5s6474h4gffk44fdh4sfv14fn4m487iodr754hdf2g1
- Password 2: hj87mkff4s5d64787uytk4gh41n3dsgapnl4kjh78yu412gkfhj4f578iyt
- Password 3: rqups45sdj7m43xby7874kghg4g7iupl4zcv4fad448784asfdf

## Rules:

- No inputs 
- The output (similar characters) must follow the order of the characters that are in the first password

## Expected output format:

- Output should only contain the answer. No other values.

Example:

If password 1 is f9u3mko, password 2 is 9o3uf, and password 3 is ybuo3jf, the expected output is:

```py
fu3o
```
The output is in ordered by the order of which the similar characters appear in passowrd 1. Output must be the SAME characters between passwords 2 AND 3 compared to password 1.
