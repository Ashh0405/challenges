# Day 3 - Christmas Challenge!

## Welcome to Day 3, a special challenge!

Merry Christmas! The ACF has a day off today, but servers never sleep. One of our main servers started malfunctioning today around 2:30 AM. You were on-call for the night, and you sleepily woke up to try and diagnose what was disturbing your Christmas slumber.

The server is continously spitting out the same message, but it doesn't make any sense.

Your job is to make sense of this message.

## Mission

After some time, you realize that the server's message is a [Caeser Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

This means that each letter is shifted over a certain number of characters. After some more time, you conclude that the message must be shifted over by 4 letters.

Your job is to reshift the message, and print out the correct message.
